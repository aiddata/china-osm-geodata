# Rasterizing project features based on commitment values

The Python code in this example can be used to produce gridded surfaces (rasters) based on the dollar value of project commitments. Only projects with geospatial features can be rasterized. The rasterized surface is produced for all projects with geospatial features, as well as subsets based on sector.
