61187," The purpose of the PNG Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project was to build gas production and processing facilities, onshore and offshore pipelines and liquefaction facilities in PNG with the capacity to produce 6.6 million tons of LNG per year.  The main components of the project include (1) an LNG plant (that consists of two LNG process trains, two 160,000 cubic metre LNG storage tanks, a marine loading terminal for LNG tankers up to 215,000 cubic meters, camp facilities, including accommodation and amenities, administration office, medical center, emergency helipad and sport and recreation center); (2) the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP); and (3) a 700 km pipeline that transports natural gas from the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant to the LNG plant. The LNG Plant is located 20 kilometres northwest of Port Moresby, at Caution Bay on the south coast of PNG’s Central Province. The LNG process involves removing impurities and cooling the gas down to a temperature cold enough to turn it into liquid form. Once achieved, the LNG is moved to specialized storage tanks. From there, the LNG goes through a pipeline connected to the jetty where it loads onto LNG carriers. These ships then export the LNG to the international market. The operation has the capacity to produce more than 8.3 million tonnes of LNG annually, an increase of 20 percent from the original design specification of 6.9 million tonnes per annum (MTA). Condensate, a low-density mixture of hydrocarbon liquids recovered through the gas liquefaction process, is also stored and loaded onto tankers for export at the LNG Plant. The Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP) is located just outside of the township of Hides in PNG’s Hela Province. The plant processes up to 1 billion standard cubic feet of gas gathered from eight wells each day. At the plant, gas, condensate and water are separated and treated before being sent via separate pipelines to other facilities in PNG for further handling. The gas is transported along a 700-kilometer-long pipeline to the LNG Plant near Port Moresby where it is converted into liquid form, ready for shipping. Around 30,000 barrels of condensate is also produced at the Plant daily. After separation, the condensate is directed along its own pipeline to the Kutubu Central Processing Facility and later the Kumul terminal for export. These production demands are met by more than 450 production staff who work around the clock every day of the year. Conditioned gas is transported from the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP) in the Highlands to the LNG Plant just outside of Port Moresby via a state-of-the-art 700-kilometre-long pipeline. The pipeline includes an onshore and an offshore portion. The onshore section of pipe has a diameter between 32 and 34 inches and is buried one meter below ground.  It travels a distance of 290 kilometers from the HGCP all the way down to the Omati River. The offshore section of pipe joins the onshore section at the Omati River and extends a further 407 kilometers to the LNG Plant. The offshore segment travels approximately 24 kilometers past Goaribari Island to the open sea, then across the Gulf of Papua to the Caution Bay landfall at the LNG Plant.

33064,"The original purpose of the project was to expand a 30.145 km (18.84 miles) segment of National Road No. 5 (NR 5) — from two lanes to four lanes — that connects the capital city of Phnom Penh with the city of Poipet at the Thai border crossing. The road segment begins at Chroy Changvar Bridge and crosses the Tonle Sap River in Phnom Penh and then extends to Preak Pnov Bridge in Prek Kdam. The ultimate purpose of the project was to boost economic opportunities for people living along the corridor. Then, on July 2, 2018, during the inauguration ceremony of the Cambodia-China Friendship Bridge (aka Psar Dey Hoi flyover), Prime Minister Hun Sen, announced that the design of the National Road No. 5 (NR 5) Expansion Project had been adjusted to follow the ‘Tomnob Kob Srov Dam route’ instead, which would be a new shortcut connecting NR 4 and NR 54. According to PM Hun Sen, the reason for the adjustment was the possibility that the original scope of the road expansion project would negatively affect local residents. A study was undertaken and it apparently demonstrated that the 4-lanes expansion could negatively affect many local homes, temples, mosques, and other public facilities.

The project is located on the right bank of the lower Baluchaung River, its upstream end being located immediately downstream of, and connecting to, the tailrace area of the existing Baluchaung No.(2) Power Station (BLC-2), with the No.(3) Power Station being located some 5.25 km further downstream near the confluence of the Baluchaung River and the Nam Pawn River. The 52MW Baluchaung 3 Hydropower Plant  discharges into the Nam Pawn River a short distance downstream of the confluence with the Baluchaung River.  Baluchaung I-III operate practically on the same river flow since water discharged from the Baluchaung I turbines directly enters the Baluchaung II headrace with virtually no intermediate catchment inflow, and Baluchaung II directly discharges water into the Baluchaung III headrace. The power plants are therefore in practice operated as one. When the central power dispatcher instructs to increase or decrease power from the Baluchaung system, all three power plants need to adjust their operation proportionally. The cascade utilizes a combined elevation difference of 650 meters and generates on average about 1,724 GWh/year, transmitted through two 220 kV transmission lines to Yangon and Swemyo respectively, a 132 kV transmission line to Mandalay, and a 33 kV distribution line to Loikaw and the surrounding area.

39326," The purpose of the PNG Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project was to build gas production and processing facilities, onshore and offshore pipelines and liquefaction facilities in PNG with the capacity to produce 6.6 million tons of LNG per year.  The main components of the project include (1) an LNG plant (that consists of two LNG process trains, two 160,000 cubic metre LNG storage tanks, a marine loading terminal for LNG tankers up to 215,000 cubic meters, camp facilities, including accommodation and amenities, administration office, medical center, emergency helipad and sport and recreation center); (2) the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP); and (3) a 700 km pipeline that transports natural gas from the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant to the LNG plant. The LNG Plant is located 20 kilometres northwest of Port Moresby, at Caution Bay on the south coast of PNG’s Central Province. The LNG process involves removing impurities and cooling the gas down to a temperature cold enough to turn it into liquid form. Once achieved, the LNG is moved to specialized storage tanks. From there, the LNG goes through a pipeline connected to the jetty where it loads onto LNG carriers. These ships then export the LNG to the international market. The operation has the capacity to produce more than 8.3 million tonnes of LNG annually, an increase of 20 percent from the original design specification of 6.9 million tonnes per annum (MTA). Condensate, a low-density mixture of hydrocarbon liquids recovered through the gas liquefaction process, is also stored and loaded onto tankers for export at the LNG Plant. The Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP) is located just outside of the township of Hides in PNG’s Hela Province. The plant processes up to 1 billion standard cubic feet of gas gathered from eight wells each day. At the plant, gas, condensate and water are separated and treated before being sent via separate pipelines to other facilities in PNG for further handling. The gas is transported along a 700-kilometer-long pipeline to the LNG Plant near Port Moresby where it is converted into liquid form, ready for shipping. Around 30,000 barrels of condensate is also produced at the Plant daily. After separation, the condensate is directed along its own pipeline to the Kutubu Central Processing Facility and later the Kumul terminal for export. These production demands are met by more than 450 production staff who work around the clock every day of the year. Conditioned gas is transported from the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP) in the Highlands to the LNG Plant just outside of Port Moresby via a state-of-the-art 700-kilometre-long pipeline. The pipeline includes an onshore and an offshore portion. The onshore section of pipe has a diameter between 32 and 34 inches and is buried one meter below ground.  It travels a distance of 290 kilometers from the HGCP all the way down to the Omati River. The offshore section of pipe joins the onshore section at the Omati River and extends a further 407 kilometers to the LNG Plant. The offshore segment travels approximately 24 kilometers past Goaribari Island to the open sea, then across the Gulf of Papua to the Caution Bay landfall at the LNG Plant.

64820,"The purpose of the project was to construct a 76MW hydropower plant along the Xeset River. The project was a run-of-river scheme with a gross head of 271 meters and an installed capacity of 76MW. The surface powerhouse was to be equipped with two Francis type turbines with an installed capacity of38 MW each. Both the generators and the turbines were manufactured by Dongfang and the generators had a designed operation lifetime of 30 years. The power plant was expected to generate an average annual production of 309,000 MWh. The project site is located on the upper Xeset River about 10 km above the Xeset 1 head pond (river distances). The Xeset II head pond collects the flow from both the Xeset and the Houay Tapoung diversion which then enters the head pond on the bank of the Xeset. The project consisted of a concrete overflow dam (114 m long x 23 m high) with an intake structure and two radial flushing gates. The head pond has an active volume of 800,000 m³ which will be used for daily peaking. The intake is situated on the right bank of head pond and leads to a 1.5 km long open canal with a gated intake, trash rack and trash rack cleaner, a 6.8 km long headrace tunnel with a 19.67 m2 to 26.30 m2 cross section, a 1.49 km long steel penstock, a surface powerhouse and a 200 m long tailrace. A vertical surface venting surge tank is located just upstream of the steel penstock. The combined catchment area for the Xeset II Hydropower Project is 392 km². The powerhouse discharge is 33.7m³/s. The powerhouse is designed to drain to the Xeset 1 head pond via a 200 m long tailrace. Access to the powerhouse and associated switchyard was to be linked to both the 115kV transmission line to Paksong and connect to Xeset 1 switch yard by a 115 kV line. The Xeset II powerhouses were to be connected via a 37 km long double-circuit 115kV transmission line from the switch yard of Xeset II to Paksong. This was to be linked to the southern supply area at Chiengxai (Ban Jianjxay) Substation. The linkage was designed to increase reliability and guaranteed electricity supply to the southern Lao and the EGAT Grid System in Thailand. A 3.1 km long 115kV transmission line was also to link the switch yards between Xeset II and Xeset 1. The Chiengxai Substation was to be be connected to Bangyo Substation which is in turn connected to the EGAT Grid. The precise locational coordinates of the Xeset II powerhouse are 15°29'15.67'N and 106°16'58.87'E. The precise locational coordinates of the Xeset II head pond are 15°24'14.86'N and 106°16'48.20'E.
